# What is inside a R package

A typical R package may have following components:

- R code: Source codes written in R
- Compiled code: Compiled C, C++ or Fortran code 
- Package metadata: Metadata such as description, dependency, author, etc. 
- Documentation: Package and function's usage
- Vignettes: More detailed instruction about how to use this package
- Tests: Unit tests for functions
- Namespace: Define what functions import/export respect to other packages
- External data: Additional dataset in this package
- Demo: A interface to running some demonstration R scripts


# How to find a package you want

- Google with appropriate keyword. For example:
    - R \<algorithm name\>
    - R \<data format\>
    - R \<package name\>
- Task view
    - [Cran Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/)
    - [R Documentation](http://www.rdocumentation.org/)
- [R-blogger](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) for latest R news


# Load package

- *library*
    - Load the namespace of the package with name package and attach it on the search list.
    - Return error if package not found

```{r}
library(data.table)
library("data.table")
```

- *require*: Just like *library* but return warning if package not found

```{r}
require(mansun)
```


# Location of libraries

- User specific library: *R_LIBS_USER*
    - Libraries under user's home directory
    - Only can be accessed by the user in most situation.

- Common library: libraries for all users. Need administrator permissoion.
    - System library: *R_HOME/library*
        - Comes with R installation
    - Site library: 
        - Configured in *R_HOME/etc/Rprofile.site*

```{r}
Sys.getenv(c("R_LIBS_USER", "R_HOME"))
```


# libPaths

Libraries in R are loaded in order:

```{r}
.libPaths()
```

You can also add an additional library path:

```r
.libPaths(c("your/library/path", .libPaths()))
```

Or change the order of library search path:

```{r}
lpath <- .libPaths()
.libPaths(lpath[c(length(lpath), 1:max(1, length(lpath)-1))])
.libPaths()
```


# Change Privilege(Windows)

# Change Privilege(Linux/Mac)

- [chown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chown): Change owner


```bash
chown mansun:mansun /usr/local/lib/R/site-library
```

- [chmod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod): Change permission of access

```bash
chmod u+w /usr/local/lib/R/site-library
```


# Where can you find a R package 

- [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/): Official R package
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): The most popular web-based git repository hosting service
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/): Also a git repository hosting service
- [R-Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/): Another CRAN-like website to access package
- [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/): Specific for biostatistician


# Install from CRAN

- [install.packages](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/install.packages.html)
    - Download and install packages from CRAN-like repositories or from local files
    - Type *? install.packages* to get further information
    - Packages are installed in the first element of *.libpaths()* if *lib* ins missing 
    - In RStudio: Tools -> Install Packages...
    - Be careful of system dependency
        - [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)(Windows), Java, XML, MySQL, ...

Install multiple files: 

```r
install.packages(c("argparser", "jsonlite"), 
    lib = "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library")
```


Install development version of data.table:

```r
install.packages("data.table", type = "source",
    repos = "https://Rdatatable.github.io/data.table")
```


# Install a local files

You can also install a local tarball:

```r
install.packages("/tmp/Rtmp99mvkt/downloaded_packages/argparser_0.4.tar.gz", 
    lib = "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library", repo = NULL, type = "source")
```


# Install from github

Using *devtools::install_github* can easily install any R package on GitHub: 

To install [devtools](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) make sure you have:
    
- [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) on Windows
- [Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads) for Mac
- *r-devel* or *r-base-dev* on Linux

Then:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Now you can install any package on github with single command:

```r
devtools::install_github('Rdatatable/data.table')
```

Just take a look what happened when you execute above command.
